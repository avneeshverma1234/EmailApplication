Hello all,
 
In the GET GCP Certified Program you receive 12-week access to Google Cloud Skills Boost platform, different from the 7-days Qwiklabs access.

The 12-week Cloud Skills Boost (CSB) access will be divided into two parts:
•	First, a 4-week access valid from October 1st, 2023. The activation time is 5 days, so you will have time by October 6th to activate the code and gain access. If you don’t activate the access by October 6th , you will therefore only be able to use the further 8-week access available from December 1st.
•	Second, an 8-week access valid from December 1st , 2023. We will send you more details closer to the activation date.

Please attend the CSB code activation session on 2nd of October 2023 at 11:15 AM - 12:00 PM BST tomorrow, if you are struggling with any issues on activation. The session will be recorded.

To enable performing labs using the 4-week CSB access within this platform please :

11.	If you performed all the actions correctly, you should be able to see the “EXPIRES ON” information on the date which is 4-weeks after your account activation.
12.	If you are still facing  any issue with the 4-weeks access after going carefully through all the steps mentioned above then please:
